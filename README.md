# EventFlow-AWS-Serverless-ETL-with-S3-Lambda-Glue-Athena
An event-driven ETL on AWS using fully managed services: S3, Lambda, Glue (Job + Crawler + Catalog) and Athena.

This repo is an implementation of an AWS ETL pipeline: ingest raw files, trigger a transformation job automatically, catalog the schema, and query with SQLâ€”no servers to manage.

ðŸ§° Tech Stack - 

Amazon S3 â€“ raw & curated data lakes

AWS Lambda â€“ event trigger + job launcher/light transforms

AWS Glue â€“ ETL job (Spark/PySpark), Crawler, Data Catalog

Amazon Athena â€“ interactive SQL on curated data

IAM â€“ least-privilege roles & policies

ðŸ§ª Data Flow Test - 

Drop a sample file into s3://<prefix>-eventflow-raw/raw/2025-10-07/â€¦

Confirm: Lambda logs show StartJobRun; Glue Job runs to completion

Run crawler â†’ tables update

Query in Athena
